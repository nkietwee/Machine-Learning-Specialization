# Welcome to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. It's already part of many daily applications, often without users realizing it.

## Everyday Examples of Machine Learning:

- **Search Engines**: Google, Bing, or Baidu use ML to rank web pages.

- **Social Media**: Apps like Instagram and Snapchat use ML to recognize and tag friends in photos.

- **Streaming Services**: Recommend similar content based on your viewing history.

- **Voice Recognition**: Voice-to-text features and virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant.

- **Email Filtering**: Detects and flags spam emails.

## Industrial and Business Applications:

- **Climate Change**: Optimizing wind turbine power generation.
- **Healthcare**: Assisting doctors in making accurate diagnoses.
- **Manufacturing**: Using computer vision to detect defects on assembly lines (e.g., Landing AI's work).
