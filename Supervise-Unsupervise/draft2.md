# üß† Supervised Learning: Summary

## üîç What is Supervised Learning?

- **Supervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from **labeled data** (input `x` paired with correct output `y`).
- The model learns a mapping from `x ‚Üí y`, so it can predict `y` for **new, unseen `x`**.

> üí° **"Supervised"** refers to the presence of the correct answer (`y`) during training.

| Application         | Input (`x`)                  | Output (`y`)               | Description                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Spam Detection      | Email content                | Spam / Not Spam            | Classifies emails                    |
| Speech Recognition  | Audio                        | Text transcript            | Converts audio to text               |
| Machine Translation | English text                 | Text in another language   | Translates language                  |
| Online Ads          | Ad info + user info          | Click / No Click           | Predicts ad clicks                   |

## üìà Types of Supervised Learning

### 1. üî¢ Regression
- **Goal**: Predict a **continuous value** (any real number).
- **Example**: Predicting **house prices** based on size.
- **Key Feature**: Output can be **any number** (e.g., $150,000, $175,500).
- **Curve fitting**: Model might use a **line** or **complex function** to fit data.

### 2. üè∑Ô∏è Classification
- **Goal**: Predict a **category or class**.
- **Example**: Diagnosing a tumor as **benign (0)** or **malignant (1)**.
- **Key Feature**: Output is from a **finite set** of possible values (e.g., 0, 1, 2).
- **Multi-Class**: Can classify into more than 2 categories (e.g., cancer types 0, 1, 2).
- **Input Example**: Tumor size + patient age ‚Üí Output: benign/malignant

## üß¨ Classification vs Regression

| Feature        | Regression                     | Classification                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Output Type    | Continuous (real numbers)      | Discrete (categories)             |
| Example        | House price prediction         | Tumor diagnosis                   |
| Output Values  | Infinite (e.g., 150.5, 174.9)  | Finite (e.g., 0, 1, 2)            |
| Curve Fit      | Line/complex function          | Decision boundary                 |

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Input features**: More features (like age, tumor thickness, cell shape) improve prediction accuracy.
- **Right answers**: Essential during training for supervised learning.
- **Prediction**: After training, the model can make predictions on new inputs.
