# üß† Supervised Learning: Overview and Examples

## üìå What is Supervised Learning?
![alt text](image.png)

                    x (input) -> y (output label)
            learn from being given  **right answer**

## Definition
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms learn **input-to-output (x ‚Üí y) mappings from `labeled` examples**. The algorithm is trained on data that includes both the input (x) and the correct output (y), enabling it to predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.
> üí° **Definition**: supervised learning algorithms learn to predict input, output or X to Y mapping.

## Key Characteristics
- Requires **labeled data** (input-output pairs).
- Goal: Predict outputs accurately for new inputs.

- **Goal**: Predict house price based on its size (in sq. ft).
- **Approach**:
  - Train on historical data: size ‚Üí price.
  - Use linear or nonlinear (curved) functions to make predictions.
- **Prediction Task**: Estimate price of a new house (e.g., 750 sq. ft).
- **Insight**: Algorithms can fit simple (line) or complex (curve) models depending on data.

## üß© Types of Supervised Learning

1. **Regression**
   - Predict **continuous values** (e.g., house prices).
   - Output can be any number.


   

2. **Classification**
   - Predict **discrete categories** (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
   - Will be covered in the next video.


unsup he data comes only with inputs x but not output labels y, and the algorithm has to find some structure or some pattern or something interesting in the data.
