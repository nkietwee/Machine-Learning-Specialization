               x (input) -> y (output label)
            learn from being given  right answer
```

## Definition
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms learn **input-to-output (x → y) mappings from labeled examples**. The algorithm is trained on data that includes both the input (x) and the correct output (y), enabling it to predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.
> 💡 **Definition**: supervised learning algorithms learn to predict input, output or X to Y mapping.

## Key Characteristics
- Requires **labeled data** (input-output pairs).
- Goal: Predict outputs accurately for new inputs.

| Application         | Input (`x`)                  | Output (`y`)               | Description                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Spam Detection      | Email content                | Spam / Not Spam            | Classifies emails                    |
| Speech Recognition  | Audio                        | Text transcript            | Converts audio to text               |
| Machine Translation | English text                 | Text in another language   | Translates language                  |
| Online Ads          | Ad info + user info          | Click / No Click           | Predicts ad clicks                   |
| Self-Driving Cars   | Images + sensors             | Car positions              | Detects surrounding vehicles         |
| Visual Inspection   | Product image                | Defect present / not       | Detects flaws in manufacturing       |
| Housing Prices      | House size (sqft)            | Price ($)                  | Predicts numeric price               |

## 🏠 Example: Predicting Housing Prices

- **Goal**: Predict house price based on its size (in sq. ft).
- **Approach**:
  - Train on historical data: size → price.
  - Use linear or nonlinear (curved) functions to make predictions.
- **Prediction Task**: Estimate price of a new house (e.g., 750 sq. ft).
- **Insight**: Algorithms can fit simple (line) or complex (curve) models depending on data.

## 🧩 Types of Supervised Learning

**1. Regression**
- **Predicts:** Continuous numerical values (infinite possible outputs )
- **Example Applications:**  
  - 🏠 Housing price prediction (size → price)  
  - 📈 Stock market forecasting  
- **Key Insight:**  
  - Fits lines/curves to infinite possible outputs  
  - Example: Predicting $150K vs $200K for a 750 sq.ft house
- **Key Feature**:
   - Output can be **any number** (e.g., $150,000, $175,500).

**2. Classification**  
- **Predicts:** Discrete categories  
- **Example Applications:**  
  - 🩺 Medical diagnosis (tumor size → benign[0]/malignant[1])  
  - 🛡️ Spam detection (email → spam/not spam)  
- **Key Insight:**  
  - Binary (2 classes) or multi-class (>2 classes)  
  - Uses decision boundaries (e.g., separating benign/malignant tumors)  
- **Key Feature**:
   - Output is from a **finite set** of possible values (e.g., 0, 1, 2).

## Key Differences: Regression vs Classification
| Feature | Regression | Classification |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Output Type** | Continuous (real numbers) | Discrete (categories)    |
| **Output Space** | Infinite numbers (e.g., 150K, 200K) | Finite categories (e.g., 0/1, cat/dog) |
| **Model Goal** | Fit optimal line/curve | Find decision boundary |
| **Evaluation** | Mean squared error | Accuracy/Precision |
| **Example** | House price prediction | Tumor diagnosis  |



unsup he data comes only with inputs x but not output labels y, and the algorithm has to find some structure or some pattern or something interesting in the data.
