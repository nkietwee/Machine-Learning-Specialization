# Machine Learning
### Definition of Machine Learning
- **Arthur Samuel** defined ML as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”

### Key Learning Insight
- The more experience (data/games) a learning algorithm has, the **better** it performs.

### Overview of Machine Learning Types
The course focuses on major types of ML:

- Supervised Learning (is the most widely used and fastest-advancing form of ML in practice.)
- Unsupervised Learning
- Recommender Systems and Reinforcement Learning
